# Projects Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository contains three data-driven projects that demonstrate my skills in data analytics, machine learning, and visualization. Each project is based on real-world scenarios, focusing on uncovering insights, solving problems, and delivering actionable results.

## 1. EDA on Retail Sales Data

## Description:

Exploratory Data Analysis on a retail sales dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights for better business decision-making.
Techniques: Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, data visualization.

**Data set:**
menu.csv
Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset.csv

### 2. Customer Segmentation

### Description:

Segmented e-commerce customers based on purchasing behavior to enable targeted marketing and improve customer satisfaction.
Techniques: Data preprocessing, clustering, outlier detection, handling missing data.

### 3. Fraud Detection

### Description:

Implemented fraud detection methods to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection and machine learning.
